      <h1 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h1>

<p>This two-day short course introduces participants to the R statistical
language. After a general overview of R syntax, the workshop covers
how to use R to wrangle data, build statistical models, and report
results through tables and graphics. Other topics such as web
scraping, writing functions, and literate programming with R are
covered. Instruction relies primarily on examples and short practice
exercises.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>All participants should have at least some experience writing
statistical code (e.g., Stata scripting) or working in another
programming language. A basic understanding of econometric modeling
(e.g., OLS regression) is also required.</p>

<h2 id="computer-requirement">Computer Requirement</h2>

<p>A laptop will be required for this workshop. Please plan to bring your
personal one, and follow instructions below to install software before
the start of the workshop. If you need to borrow a laptop, please
contact <a href="mailto:CurryVEST@virginia.edu">CurryVEST@virginia.edu</a> before
Wednesday, January 10th.</p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>Before the workshop, participants will need to install R and R Studio,
both of which are free and run on all major platforms, as well as
number of R packages. It is important that participants
attempt to install all software before the workshop because there will
be limited time for troubleshooting. Other free software, such as Git,
TeX, and Markdown, may also be referenced in the workshop, but will
not be strictly required.</p>

<p>See the <a href="/rworkshop/start">getting started</a> for links to required software and instructions for
installing packages in R.</p>

<h1 id="date">Date</h1>

<p>The course will take place on Monday, January 15, and Tuesday,
January 16. For a complete schedule and links to modules, see the
<a href="/rworkshop/schedule">schedule</a>.</p>

<h1 id="about-me">About me</h1>

<p>I am currently a <a href="https://curry.virginia.edu/benjamin-skinner">Research Assistant Professor of
Education</a> at the
University of Virginia with an affiliation in
<a href="https://curry.virginia.edu/faculty-research/centers-labs-projects/edpolicyworks">EdPolicyWorks</a>. My
research interests center on the policies and practices that affect
students who attend community colleges and open access
universities. In recent work, I have focused on the relationships
between online course delivery and student enrollments, course
outcomes, and degree attainment.</p>

<p>In addition to using the R language extensively in my own work, I am
also the author and maintainer of a number of software packages,
including <a href="https://www.btskinner.me/rscorecard/">rscorecard</a>, which
can be used to download data from the <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov">College
Scorecard</a>, and
<a href="https://www.btskinner.me/crosswalkr/">crosswalkr</a>, a port of a <a href="https://github.com/slhudson/rename-and-encode">set
of Stata commands</a> that
help build master data sets from smaller files in a reproducible manner.</p>

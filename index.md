# Synopsis

This two-day short course introduces participants to the R statistical
language. After a general overview of R syntax, workshop 
[modules]({{ site.baseurl }}/modules/) cover how to:   

* wrangle data using both base R and tidyverse functions,
* reshape data frames,
* explore data using summary statistics and graphics, 
* build statistical models, and
* write loops and short functions. 

Instruction relies primarily on examples and short practice
exercises.

## Prerequisites 

All participants should have at least some experience writing
statistical code (e.g., Stata scripting) or working in another
programming language. A basic understanding of statistical modeling
(e.g., OLS regression) is also required.

Participants in the 3rd day follow-up either need to have taken the
first two days of the workshop or have permission of the instructor.

## Computer Requirement 

A laptop will be required for this workshop. Please plan to bring your
personal one, and follow instructions below to install software before
the start of the workshop. If you need to borrow a laptop, please
contact [CurryVEST@virginia.edu](mailto:CurryVEST@virginia.edu) before
Friday, May 11.

## Software 

Before the workshop, participants will need to install R and R Studio,
both of which are free and run on all major platforms, as well as
number of R packages. It is important that participants
attempt to install all software before the workshop because there will
be limited time for troubleshooting. Other free software, such as Git,
TeX, and Markdown, may also be referenced in the workshop, but will
not be strictly required. 

If you already have R, R Studio, and related packages, please update
everything before the workshop. 

See the [getting started]({{ site.baseurl
}}/start) for links to required software and instructions for
installing packages in R.

# Date

The 3rd day course will take place on Thursday, May 17. For a complete

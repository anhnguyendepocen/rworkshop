# Synopsis

This two-day short course introduces participants to the R statistical
language. After a general overview of R syntax, the workshop covers
how to use R to wrangle data, build statistical models, and report
results through tables and graphics. Other topics such as web
scraping, writing functions, and literate programming with R are
covered. Instruction relies primarily on examples and short practice
exercises.

## Prerequisites 

All participants should have at least some experience writing
statistical code (e.g., Stata scripting) or working in another
programming language. A basic understanding of econometric modeling
(e.g., OLS regression) is also required.

## Computer Requirement 

A laptop will be required for this workshop. Please plan to bring your
personal one, and follow instructions below to install software before
the start of the workshop. If you need to borrow a laptop, please
contact [CurryVEST@virginia.edu](mailto:CurryVEST@virginia.edu) before
Wednesday, January 10th.

## Software 

Before the workshop, participants will need to install R and R Studio,
both of which are free and run on all major platforms, as well as
number of R packages. It is important that participants
attempt to install all software before the workshop because there will
be limited time for troubleshooting. Other free software, such as Git,
TeX, and Markdown, may also be referenced in the workshop, but will
not be strictly required. 

See the [getting started]({{ site.baseurl
}}/start) for links to required software and instructions for
installing packages in R.


# Date

The course will take place on Monday, January 15, and Tuesday,

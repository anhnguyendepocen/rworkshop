R has undergone a transformation in the past few years and this may
affect how you choose to approach data wrangling. While the core R
functions for data manipulation are still the same, a new
suite of packages, the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org)
(formerly known as the "Hadleyverse" after their key
creator, [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz)), has really changed the
way many people use R.

In this module, I'm going to show you how to wrangle data the
tidyverse way. The sequence is almost the same as those in the last
module. In the end, it's up to you which approach you prefer. 

Data for this module are the same as those used in the last, from the
[NCES Education Longitudinal Study of
2002](https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/els2002/). For descriptions of the
variables, see the <a href = '{{ site.baseurl
}}/data/#els_planscsv'>codebook</a>. If you saved your cleaned up data
set using the same name, go ahead and download a fresh copy of the
original data.

# Tidyverse

The tidyverse is a shorthand for
a [number of packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) that work
well together and can be used in place of base R functions. A few of
the tidyverse packages that you will often use are:

* [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org) for data manipulation  
* [tidyr](http://tidyr.tidyverse.org) for making
  data [tidy](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html)  
* [readr](http://readr.tidyverse.org) for flat file I/O  
* [readxl](http://readxl.tidyverse.org) for Excel file I/O  
* [haven](http://haven.tidyverse.org) for other file format I/O  
* [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org) for making graphics  

There are many others. A lot of R users find functions from these
libraries to be more intuitive than base R functions. In some cases,
tidyverse functions are faster than base R, which is an added benefit
when working with large data sets.

## Magrittr and pipes

The key feature of the tidyverse is its use of pipes, `%>%`, from the
[magrittr package](http://magrittr.tidyverse.org). 

<span style="display:block;text-align:center">
[![badge](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/magrittr.png)](https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/uploads/exhibitions/images/magritte_la_trahison_des_images_large@2x.jpg)
</span>

Pipes take output from the left side and pipe it to the input of the
right side. So `sum(x)` can be rewritten as `x %>% sum`: `x` outputs
itself and the pipe, `%>%`, makes it the input for `sum()`.

This is a silly example (why would you do that?), but pipes are
powerful because they can be chained together. Functions can be nested
in R, but after too many, the code becomes difficult to parse since it
has to be read from the inside out. Pipes allow functions to come one
after another in the order of the work being done.

Let's use [Hadley's canonical
example](https://twitter.com/_inundata/status/557980236130689024) to
make the readability comparison between nested functions and piped
functions clearer:

```r
## foo_foo is an instance of a little bunny
foo_foo <- little_bunny()

## adventures in base R must be read from the middle up and backwards
bop_on(
    scoop_up(
        hop_through(foo_foo, forest),
        field_mouse
    ),
    head
)

## adventures w/ pipes start at the top and work down
foo_foo %>%
    hop_through(forest) %>%
    scoop_up(field_mouse) %>%
    bop_on(head)

```

# Data wrangling with tidyverse

```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = TRUE}
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Data wrangling with tidyverse
## -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

```
```{r}
## library
library(tidyverse)

```

Let's reread the original data. Like `read.table()`, `read_delim()` is
the generic function that needs you to give it the
separating/delimiting character. You could also just use `read_csv()`.

```{r}
## read in the data
df <- read_delim('../data/els_plans.csv', delim = ',')

```

Unlike the base R `read.table()` function, `read_delim()` prints out
information about how the data were read in. Nothing is wrong! The
`read_delim()` function, like many other functions in the tidyverse,
assumes you'd rather have more rather than less information and so
acts accordingly.

We can see which columns
were read in as doubles (`col_double()`) and which as integers
(`col_integer()`). If the column name isn't in the list, then it was
read in as the `.default`, which was as a character column
(`col_character()`). 

## Mutate
```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = TRUE}
## ---------------------------
## mutate
## ---------------------------

```

To add variables and change existing ones, use the `mutate()`
function. 

Most if not all of the primary tidyverse functions take the
data object as the first argument. So the `mutate()` function would be
`mutate(df, ...)` where `...` is the stuff we want to do. Because we're
using the `%>%`, however, we start with the data by itself and pipe it
into the `mutate()` function. We'll do this with the rest of the
tidyverse functions. While not necessary, I think it helps reading
through the code: *Starting with the data (`df`), we next create new
variables with the `mutate()` function...* and so on.

Note that with tidyverse functions, you usually don't need to use the
data frame name with the dollar sign construction (`df$<var_name>`)
and you don't need to put quotation marks around the column
names. There are some rare cases where you do, but we won't get into
those.

```{r}
## assign values inside function using = sign (not <-)
df <- df %>%
    mutate(ones = 1,
           avg_test = (bynels2r + bynels2m) / 2) # ignore neg vals

```

To conditionally mutate variables, use the `ifelse()` construction
inside the `mutate()` function.

```{r}
## (1) make a numeric column that == 1 if bysex is female, 0 otherwise
## (2) assign DOB an NA if < 0
df <- df %>%
    mutate(female = ifelse(bysex == 'female', 1, 0),
           bydob_p = ifelse(bydob_p < 0, NA, bydob_p))           

```

> #### Quick exercise 
> Create dummy variables for each race/ethnicity category in `byrace`. (Hint:
> use (`table()`) to see the possible values; adv. hint: `ifelse()`
> statements can be nested.) 


## Select
```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = TRUE}
## ---------------------------
## select
## ---------------------------

```

To choose variables, either when making a new data frame or dropping
them, use `select()`. Without assignment (because we would change our
data object and we don't want to), let's use `select()` to view
the first few rows of the student and school ids.

```{r}
## just view first few rows of stu_id and sch_id (no assignment)
df %>% select(stu_id, sch_id)

```

To drop variables, use a negative sign (`-`) in front of the variable
name. This time, we will reassign the results to `df`, which means
that the column `f1pnlwt` will be dropped from the data frame.

```{r}
## drop follow up one panel weight
df <- df %>% select(-f1pnlwt)

## check names
names(df)

```

> #### Quick exercise 
> Without assigning back to your data frame (no `<-`), see if you can
> first keep a set of variables and then drop a set of
> variables. (Hint: consider `c()`)

## Filter
```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = TRUE}
## ---------------------------
## filter
## ---------------------------

```

Like `select()` works on columns, `filter()` can be used to subset
based on row conditions. Earlier we properly labeled `bydob_p` values
less than zero as `NA`. Let's drop those.
```{r}
## show number of rows
nrow(df)

## keep if not (!) missing
df <- df %>% filter(!is.na(bydob_p))
nrow(df)

```

> #### Quick exercise 
> Filter out observations if they are missing `bysex` values. You can
> do it in two steps, first `mutate()`ing negative values to be `NA`
> and then `filter()`ing out missing values, or in one step, just
> `filter()`ing out if `bysex` has a value below zero. 

## Arrange
```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = TRUE}
## ---------------------------
## arrange
## ---------------------------

```

Sort values using the `arrange()` function.
```{r}
## show first few rows of student and base year math scores (tidyverse way)
df %>% select(stu_id, bydob_p) %>% head(10)

## arrange
df <- df %>% arrange(bydob_p)

## show again first few rows of ID and DOB
df %>% select(stu_id, bydob_p) %>% head(10)

```

> #### Quick exercise 
> `arrange()` by `bydob_p` again, but this time in reverse
> order. Google "dplyr arrange" to find information about the function
> and see if can figure out how to sort in descending order.

## Summarize
```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = TRUE}
## ---------------------------
## summarize
## ---------------------------

```
Aggregate data using the `summarise()` or `summarize()` function
(they're the same, just playing nice by offering both
spellings). Unlike the `aggregate()` function, you first need to set
the grouping variable using the `group_by()` function. Since we need
to replace negative values before we summarize, we'll chain a few
functions together into one command.

Notice how we can include comment rows between each piped
command. Adding a comment before each function that explains the step
in a human-friendly manner can be particularly helpful when chaining
multiple functions together. Or you can work the other way,
writing [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode) first
and then adding the R code afterwards.

```{r}
## create new data frame
sch_m <- df %>%
    ## (1) make test score values < 0 into NAs
    mutate(bynels2m = ifelse(bynels2m < 0, NA, bynels2m)) %>%
    ## (2) group by school ID
    group_by(sch_id) %>%
    ## (3) get the average math score, removing missing values
    summarise(sch_bynels2m = mean(bynels2m, na.rm = TRUE))

## show
sch_m

```

> #### Quick exercise
> Find the average reading test score for each school and save it in
> an object.

The `group_by()` and `summarise()` functions are very useful for
generating summary statistics and exploring your data. We'll use them
more in the modules on exploratory data analysis.

## Join
```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = TRUE}
## ---------------------------
## join
## ---------------------------

```

Rather than saying "merge," dplyr uses the SQL language of joins:

* `left_join(x, y)`: keep all x, drop unmatched y
* `right_join(x, y)`: keep all y, drop unmatched x
* `inner_join(x, y)`: keep only matching
* `full_join(x, y)`: keep everything

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/joins.png" alt="Joins">

Since we want to join a smaller aggregated data frame to the original
data frame, we'll use a `left_join()`. The join functions will try to
guess the joining variable (and tell you what it picked) if you don't
supply one, but we'll specify one to be clear.

```{r}
## join on school ID variable
df <- df %>% left_join(sch_m, by = 'sch_id')

```

> #### Quick exercise
> Join the average reading test score data frame you made to the main
> data object.

## Write
```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = TRUE}
## ---------------------------
## write
## ---------------------------

```

The readr library can also write delimited flat files. Instead of
`write_delim()`, we'll use the wrapper function `write_csv()` to save
a csv file. Again, it's a good habit to save any modified data using a
different name so that your raw data stays untouched. We'll add
`_mod_tv` to the data name so that we don't overwrite raw data or the
modified data set we made in the last module.

```{r, eval = FALSE, purl = TRUE}
## write flat file
write_csv(df, '../data/els_plans_mod_tv.csv')

```

```{r, echo = FALSE, purl = TRUE}

Welcome!

This site hosts the lessons for a two-day workshop on R held in
the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia on January
15-16, 2018, hosted as part of the Virginia Education Science
Training (VEST) Program at UVa.

The purpose of the workshop is to introduce researchers who primarily
work in the social science fields of education, economics, and public
policy to the R statistical language. As a standard disclaimer, two
days (or a few modules) aren't enough to show everything that R has to
offer. Instead, I hope this workshop serves as an introduction to the
most common data analysis procedures and gives participants a chance
to practice working with R themselves.

# Structure of the course

All modules are scheduled to last about 90 minutes. Within that time
frame, the goal is that demonstration of the content will take up
about an hour, with interspersed quick exercises taking up the rest
of the time. 

R scripts for each module (less the markdown content used to build the
site) can be downloaded, and participants should use them to follow
along with the demonstration on their own machines.

Questions throughout are highly encouraged. Aside from wrecking my
voice, it will dreadfully boring to hear me talk about coding for two
entire days!

# This website

All the files needed for the workshop can be accessed through this
site. I've also tried to write up the modules so that they are useful
after the fact or for others who didn't attend the workshop in
person. Please contact me with any suggestions for improvements. [Pull
requests](https://github.com/btskinner/rworkshop/pulls) are great, but
emails or tweets are fine, too.

# About me

I am a [Research Assistant Professor of
Education]({{ site.contact.uva_url }}) at the
University of Virginia with an affiliation in
[EdPolicyWorks]({{ site.epw.url }}). My
research interests center on the policies and practices that affect
students who attend community colleges and open access
universities. In recent work, I have focused on the relationships
between online course delivery and student enrollments, course
outcomes, and degree attainment.

In addition to using the R language extensively in my own work, I am
the author and maintainer of a number of software packages,
including [rscorecard](https://www.btskinner.me/rscorecard/), which
can be used to download data from the [College
Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov), and
[crosswalkr](https://www.btskinner.me/crosswalkr/), a port of a [set
of Stata commands](https://github.com/slhudson/rename-and-encode) that
help build master data sets from smaller files in a reproducible
manner.
